    <h2>What is Plagiarism</h2>
    <p>Plagiarism, the act of presenting someone else's work or ideas as one's own without proper acknowledgment, has severe consequences across various countries. Notable cases include a U.S. Senator losing his Master's degree due to plagiarized academic work and a college president resigning over similar allegations. In the U.S., penalties can range from academic expulsion to fines between $2,500 and $250,000. In the UAE, failure to cite sources is considered a serious insult, while in China, cultural norms may downplay citation importance despite legal protections for intellectual property. Eastern European nations are working to combat plagiarism through stricter policies and software tools.</p>
